- The updated PEP can be found at
- http://docutils.sourceforge.net/spec/pep-xxxx.txt,
- until it's assigned a number.
- 'Paul Moore wrote:'
- '> I''d suggest that you add a "Benefits" section, explaining the'
- "> advantages to the individual programmer - not to the community as"
- "> a whole - of the proposal."
- Good idea.  Your list of benefits added.  Any others?
- '> .. [1] Actually, it''s arguable that the similarity to "existing'
- '>        practice" makes getting the syntax right harder. I never'
- ">        get footnote syntax right without checking (and I may have"

- '>        covering in a Q&A. "Q: Won''t the superficial similarity to'
- ">        existing markup conventions cause problems, and result in"
- ">        people writing invalid markup (and not noticing, because"
- '>        the plaintext looks natural)?"'
- Question & answer added (#9)
- "> Interestingly (and possibly relevantly) it's not clear to me that"
- "> these benefits are overwhelming. It's more a case of the cost being"
- "> minimal [4]_, and the potential benefits being reasonable."
- I think it's a case of the benefits not being obviously significant,
- until the standards and tools are there, and then we'll all wonder how
- we ever lived without them!  Perhaps not that significant, but you
- get my meaning.
- "> Maybe we need to focus more strongly on getting tools working."
- Yes, of course, and any help is gladly appreciated.  The thing about
- scratching itches, is that you never know where or how they'll
- manifest.
- '> Something on the level of "look - I generated a help file and some'
- "> printed documentation, and pydoc produces well-formatted information"
- "> - all without doing anything more than using reST in my"
- '> docstrings". People respond better to demonstrations than to'
- "> standards..."
- This is a classic chicken-and-egg situation.  Without tools, we can't
- get acceptance, but in this case producing the tools is such a big job
- that some form of acceptance up front is needed to keep up enthusiasm
- "(mine, if nobody else's).  One reason for putting this PEP out there"
- now, is that I'm at a point where I've put a lot of work into this
- project, and it's starting to pay off, but I need some reassurance to
- keep me going.  I want to know that I'm on the right track, that I'm
- not wasting my time, and getting this PEP accepted would go a long way
- in that direction.
- Even if this PEP is rejected, that will be useful information.  If
- accepted, then I can forget about supporting multiple markup parsers
- in Docutils, at least for now.  If rejected, support for multiple
- parsers may be its saving grace.
- '>        ... how forgiving is reST going to be of "not quite right"'
- ">        constructs?"
- Added to the Q&A as part of the other question (#9).
- "> PS I just noticed that I manually numbered the footnotes in this"
- "> message - even though I needed to renumber at one point. In"
- "> practice, I don't think I'd ever use the ``[#]`` notation for"
- '> auto-numbering. It''s too hard to follow in "raw text" form. Just a'
- "> data point..."
- That's where using labels helps.  Instead of plain ``[#]``, use
- "``[#a]`` or something more meaningful like ``[#subset]``.  You get"
- both automatic numbering and easy to follow references.
- Thanks for the feedback.
